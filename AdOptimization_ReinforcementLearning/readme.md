# 🧠 Ad Click Optimization with Reinforcement Learning

This project explores **Reinforcement Learning** strategies to optimize online ad selections. Using the **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** and **Thompson Sampling** algorithms, we simulate how a system can learn—through trial and error—which ads users are more likely to click.

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases
Online advertising & recommendation engines

Personalized content delivery

A/B testing and optimization scenarios

## 🎯 Project Goal

The objective is to **maximize click-through rates (CTR)** for ads by selecting the most effective ad over time using smart learning strategies rather than random guessing.

## 🧪 Algorithms Implemented

### 1️⃣ Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) – `UCBReinforcemenetLearning.ipynb`
- Balances exploration vs exploitation
- Picks ads based on confidence intervals
- Great for early-stage decision-making with limited data

### 2️⃣ Thompson Sampling – `ThomsonSampling.ipynb`
- Bayesian method that balances exploration probabilistically
- Picks ads based on sampled probability distributions
- Learns faster and performs better with noisy feedback

---

## 📁 Dataset: `Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv`

- Simulated binary dataset representing ad displays
- Each row = one round of ad selection
- Columns = results for each of the 10 ads (1 = clicked, 0 = not clicked)
