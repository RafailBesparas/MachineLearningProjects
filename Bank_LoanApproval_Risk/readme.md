# Loan Approval: Will They Get the Green Light? (Neural Network Edition)

**What's the Gig?** We're building a brainy AI (neural network, to be precise) to predict if a loan gets the thumbs-up or thumbs-down. Think of it as a digital loan officer with super-powered pattern recognition.

**Under the Hood:** TensorFlow and Keras are our tools of choice. We're throwing a bunch of data at the model – credit scores, income, the works – to see if it can learn the magic formula for loan approval.

**The Adventure So Far:**

* **Data Wrangling:** We wrestled the data into shape (cleaning, scaling, the usual suspects).
* **Building the Brain:** We crafted a neural network with layers, activations, and a dash of dropout to keep things interesting.
* **Training Time:** We fed the model data, tweaked the knobs, and watched it learn (or try to!).

**The Catch?** This project's still a work in progress! Code cleanup and fine-tuning are on the to-do list. Plus, the current accuracy is... let's just say it's got room to grow. If our neural network is still stubborn, we'll bring in a pre-trained heavy hitter to show it how it's done.

**What's Next?** Hyperparameter tuning, better evaluation, and, hopefully, a model that can predict loan approvals like a boss. Stay tuned!
