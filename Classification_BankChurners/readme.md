# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction in Banking

In today’s highly competitive banking sector, **customer retention** is crucial for driving growth and maximizing profitability. **Customer churn**—when clients leave the bank—can cause substantial revenue loss and disrupt long-term financial planning.

This project harnesses the power of **machine learning** and **deep learning** to accurately predict which customers are most likely to churn. Armed with these insights, banks can proactively engage at-risk clients, reduce churn, and strengthen customer relationships.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To develop a predictive system that identifies high-risk customers **before** they leave, enabling the bank to take **data-driven actions** for retention.

---

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Uncovered key patterns and correlations related to customer churn.
  - Visualized customer demographics and behavior for strategic insights.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Implemented and compared models like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
  - Evaluated performance using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

- **Deep Learning Approach**:
  - Built a **Neural Network** using **TensorFlow/Keras** to capture complex data relationships.
  - Achieved high accuracy in predicting customer churn, outperforming traditional models in some cases.

- **Model Interpretability**:
  - Used feature importance and SHAP values to understand **why** customers are likely to churn.
  - Delivered actionable insights for the bank’s retention strategies.
