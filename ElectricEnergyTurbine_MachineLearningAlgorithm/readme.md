⚡ Predicting Energy Output of a Power Plant with Machine Learning

🚀 Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict the net hourly energy output (in Megawatts) of a power plant based on key environmental parameters. Utilizing both traditional regression models and deep learning techniques—specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Residual Networks (ResNet)—we aim to build accurate and scalable solutions for real-time energy forecasting.

🎯 Objective

Develop predictive models to estimate power plant energy output using environmental data.

Compare the performance of classical models with deep learning architectures.

Deploy the best-performing model through a REST API for real-time inference.
